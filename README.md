numberGuessingGame
==================

Number guessing as played in the "Adaptive Systems" lecture at TU-Graz.

Currently there are two modes available:

1.) User guesses (main.html).
2.) A user supplied Code guesses (main-ai.html).

There are two example AI codes supplied, one guesses randomly
(ai_example_random.js) and the other one is a naive implementation of
the gradient descent algorithm.
